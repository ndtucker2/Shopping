<h2>Rewards You Gain When Shopping</h2>
<h3>Accomplishments</h3>
<p>There's nothing better than gaining a feeling of <span style="color:pink;font-weight:bold"><em>accomplishment</em></span> 
when something you have been working on getting finally becomes a reality. Having that relief 
and knowledge that you have finally saved enough to purchase an item you have been fantasizing 
about adding to your collection is such a rewarding feeling.</p>

<h3>Altruism</h3>
<p>Not only is there a reward in purchasing items for yourself, but there is also the option 
of <span style="color:pink;font-weight:bold"><em>giving</em></span> gifts to those who hold a 
significance of importance to you. Showing that you are thinking of someone while shopping 
is a great way to establish that connection of love and importance.</p>
